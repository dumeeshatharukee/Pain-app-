## 🧠 How It Works

The app uses mouse events to control the drawing on a `<canvas>` element.

- **`startDrawing()`** – Captures the starting X/Y position when the mouse is pressed and enables drawing mode.
- 
- **`draw()`** – Tracks mouse movement to create smooth strokes in real time.
- 
- **`endDrawing()`** – Stops drawing and finalizes the stroke when the mouse is released.
